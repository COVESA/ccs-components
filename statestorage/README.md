The vehicle state storage is used in the Genivi CCS project as a buffer between the Data server and the underlying "native" vehicle signal subsystem. The state storage manager provides the following services in this context:<br>
1. The creation of the SQL database that realizes this buffer.<br>
2. Population of the database with the paths to all VSS nodes as defined at https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification.<br>
3. Creation of a mapping between VSS paths and any "non-VSS" signal address space.<br><br>
The services 1. and 2. are performed by executing the state storage manager with the following two command line parameters:<br>
A. The path and name for the new SQL database. This should NOT point to an existing file.<br>
B. The path and name to a file containing all the VSS paths. An example of such a file is the vsspathlist.json. 
This file is generated by the Gen2 server at startup, see <a href="https://github.com/MEAE-GOT/W3C_VehicleSignalInterfaceImpl">W3C_VehicleSignalInterfaceImpl</a>, 
from where it should be copied to get alignment with the VSS tree used by the Gen2 server.
However, it can also be generated by the <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/ccs-w3c-client/tree/master/ovds/client)">OVDS client</a>.<br><br>
The service 3. is performed by executing the state storage manager with one command line parameter:<br>
C. The path and name for an existing SQL database created by the state storage manager.
A dialogue is then started where the manager first asks for the name of the "non-VSS address space.<br>
The name provided can either lead to creation of a new mapping to be initiated, if the manager does not find a table with that name. 
The name should only consist of characters [a-z, A-Z, 0-9].
If it finds a table with the name, it assumes that the user wants to map further VSS signals to signals in this address space.<br>
The dialogue supporting the mapping is only providing the most essential functions:<br>
- Map a non-VSS text based "handle" to a VSS path that has not been mapped before.<br>
- Go to the next non-mapped VSS path<br>
- Search among non-mapped VSS path for a path to map.<br>
- Quit the dialogue.<br><br>
The manager does currently not support change of already mapped signals, or removal of entire "non-VSS" mapping tables. 
As the databae is a standard SQL database, standard SQL tools can be used for that.<br><br>
The manager is not meant to be used when the database is used for transferring data from a non-VSS domain to the VSS domain. 
In the CSS context there will then be a "feeder" in the non-VSS domain that writes data into the database, and the Data server that reads data into the VSS domain. 
The feeder can be coded in any language, but the SQL query for writing into the database will look (more or less) the same in all languages. 
As a help for the coding of a feeder the query, as it looks in a Go language context.
The non-VSS address space is in this example assumed to be called XXX, hence the table is named XXX_MAP.<br>
First get the signal_id associated to the non-VSS handle by this query: "SELECT signal_id FROM XXX_MAP WHERE handle=?"<br>
Then write the value and timestamp by this query: "UPDATE VSS_MAP SET value=?, timestamp=? WHERE signal_id=?"
The timestamp should follow the ISO8601 format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssssZ", where the sub-second part is optional.
